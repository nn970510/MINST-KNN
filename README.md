# CS512-DSA
Algorithm is in /uupload/Knndraft.py
The UI call KNN by using /uupload/importpic.py. It fix the k value, subsampling and training set size.
/uupload/importpictest.py is for test performance of KNN. there are four parameters: -t, training set size (1-100)
-d using sub-sampling or not (0 or 1), -k, K value (1-10), -s test set size (1-100).
